# The Storage Engine

The Storage Engine is the foundation of QoreDB, responsible for managing the physical storage of data. It ensures that data is stored reliably and can be accessed efficiently.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Data Persistence**: Reading and writing data to and from the disk.
- **Memory Management**: Caching frequently accessed data in memory to reduce disk I/O.
- **Indexing**: Providing fast access to data using data structures like B+ Trees.

This section covers the core components of the storage engine: the Pager and the B+ Tree.
